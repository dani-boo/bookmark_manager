# Carry on here in Walkthrough: We can now flesh out the route, saving the submitted data to the database:
# Controller class
require 'sinatra/base'
require './lib/bookmark'

class BookmarkManager < Sinatra::Base
  get '/' do
    redirect '/bookmarks'
  end

  get '/bookmarks' do
    # p ENV
    @bookmarks = Bookmark.all
    erb :index
  end

  get '/bookmarks/new' do
    erb :"bookmarks/new"
  end

  post '/bookmarks' do
    p "Form data submitted to the /bookmarks route!"
  end

  run! if app_file == $0
end
